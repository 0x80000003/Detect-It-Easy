### Key Advantages:

- **Flexible Signature Management**: DIE‚Äôs open architecture allows users to easily create, modify, and optimize signatures, making it adaptable for unique analysis needs.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and MacOS, offering native compatibility for a wide range of OS environments. This flexibility allows it to be deployed across multiple systems, providing a universal solution for analysts.
- **Minimal False Positives**: Combined signature and heuristic analysis ensures reliable detection accuracy, minimizing the potential for false positives in scanning.

## üìÑ Supported File Types

DIE currently supports an extensive range of executable and archive types, making it highly versatile for different analytical contexts:

- **PE** (Portable Executable format for Windows)
- **ELF** (Executable and Linkable Format for Linux)
- **APK** (Android Application Package)
- **IPA** (iOS Application Package)
- **JAR** (Java Archive)
- **ZIP** (Compressed archives and similar formats)
- **DEX** (Dalvik Executable for Android)
- **MS-DOS** (MS-DOS executable files)
- **COM** (Simple executable format, often for DOS)
- **LE/LX** (Linear Executable for OS/2)
- **MACH** (Mach-O files for MacOS)
- **NPM** (JavaScript packages)
- **Amiga** (Executable format for Amiga computers)
- **Binary** (Other unclassified files)

Unknown formats undergo heuristic analysis, providing identification for both known and unrecognized files. DIE‚Äôs compatibility with lesser-known formats like **COM** and **DEX** further underscores its versatility in digital forensics and reverse engineering.

## üîë Key Features

- **Flexible Signature Management**: With DIE, users can define their own detection signatures or modify existing ones to refine analysis results. This flexibility, along with DIE‚Äôs **open signature architecture**, makes it highly adaptable for analyzing both common and rare file types.
  
- **Scripted Detection**: Custom detection algorithms can be created using DIE‚Äôs JavaScript-like scripting language. This capability allows advanced users to perform specialized analyses, including deep unpacking and targeted detection routines tailored for complex or encrypted file structures.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: DIE is available for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, with separate GUI and command-line (CLI) versions. This cross-platform support is essential for analysts working in different environments, allowing consistent functionality across systems.

- **Reduced False Positives**: DIE leverages a combination of signature and heuristic scanning to ensure high detection accuracy. This reduces the likelihood of false positives, which is especially important in scenarios where detection precision is critical.
